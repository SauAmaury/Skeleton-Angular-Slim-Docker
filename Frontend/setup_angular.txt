I'm assuming you already have Angular CLI installed on your device
To create your new Angular app use the commands below :

cd /Frontend
ng new appName --directory .

WARNING !! If you change the name of the app, you have to update the path in the docker-compose.yml replacing "appName" by the new name you just entered

For compiling, use :

cd /Frontend
ng build --watch
